            <p>To listen to some of the Labour debate today you might think that Tony Blair's election as leader in 1994 was the beginning of the end.
            As it happened it was not the end, but the prelude to the longest continuous period in power that Labour has ever had - 13 years.
            But Blair's first conference speech as leader in 1994 is now an emblem of history that much of his party wants to erase.
            There is no modern equivalent for a cultural shift in a party that has been so quick and so complete.
            Call yourself a Blairite these days and you might as well be a leper in the Middle Ages ringing a bell to advertise your shame and sending people running from the streets.
            Why?
            The simple answer would be Iraq. And there's no doubt that across the Labour Party there's an overwhelming view that the Iraq invasion was a mistake and, most of them think, a deceitful one.
            Then there's the money attached to the Blair name, which has been damaging too.
            But even taken together, these factors are not enough to explain the surge of support for Jeremy Corbyn - a candidate who, remember, had to round up proxies to get enough nominations from MPs to get into the leadership contest in the first place.</p>
